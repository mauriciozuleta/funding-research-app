      <h4 class="mt-4">What I can do for you</h4>
      <p>Hi! I’m your Funding Intelligence Agent, and here’s how I can support your research journey:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I search through public funding APIs, open datasets, and ethically allowed web sources to find opportunities that might fit your work.</li>
        <li>I read and break down funding calls you paste into the app — highlighting priorities, eligibility clues, constraints, and potential risks.</li>
        <li>I estimate how well a call aligns with your research profile and explain why.</li>
        <li>I help you get started with your proposal by drafting sections like the abstract, significance, innovation, or training plan.</li>
        <li>I can also turn your research profile into a clean, funder-facing banner to share with mentors, collaborators, or potential supporters.</li>
        <li>And if you want, I’ll send alerts or weekly digests whenever something new appears that might be relevant to you.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 class="mt-4">How I work (quick and simple)</h4>
      <p>I combine:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Public funding APIs</li>
        <li>Allowed web scraping</li>
        <li>Your research profile</li>
        <li>AI-powered reasoning</li>
      </ul>
      <p>to speed up your search and help you prepare early-stage materials.<br>Think of me as your research grant co-pilot, not a magic grant machine.</p>
      <h4 class="mt-4">What I cannot do</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>I can’t promise that every opportunity I find is complete, up-to-date, or perfect for your situation.</li>
        <li>I can’t confirm your eligibility — only the official agency can do that.</li>
        <li>I can’t submit applications, fill out forms, or interact with external portals.</li>
        <li>I can’t replace your mentors, grant office, or the official guidelines.</li>
        <li>And because I’m AI, I may occasionally misunderstand something — so anything I generate should always be double-checked by you.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 class="mt-4">What you’ll still need to do</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Read each funding call carefully</li>
        <li>Verify your eligibility</li>
        <li>Edit and refine all draft text</li>
        <li>Prepare budgets, letters, and compliance materials</li>
        <li>Coordinate with your grant office or mentors</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I’ll guide you — but you drive the process.</p>
